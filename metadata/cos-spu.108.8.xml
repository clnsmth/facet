          <para>The methods for collecting pebble count data are based on the Wolman Pebble count method. The b-axis, or medium axis, of the sediment particle to the nearest mm is measured using a see-through ruler. Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear. For measurements less than 2 mm, record 1. Do not assume a particle is less than 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis, or long axis, then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis, or short axis, and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect, which is usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot. If your blind touch results in touching fine sediment on top of larger rocks, the fine sediment is what is measured as it was the first particle that came into contact with your finger. The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</para>

Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects.

          <attributeDefinition>Pebble B-Axis Length (mm) of Particle 41. The b-axis (medium axis) of the sediment particle is measured to the nearest mm using a see-through ruler. Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

          <attributeDefinition>Pebble B-Axis Length (mm) of Particle 118. The b-axis (medium axis) of the sediment particle is measured to the nearest mm using a see-through ruler. Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

          <attributeDefinition>Pebble B-Axis Length (mm) of Particle 129. The b-axis (medium axis) of the sediment particle is measured to the nearest mm using a see-through ruler. Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

          <attributeDefinition>Pebble B-Axis Length (mm) of Particle 140. The b-axis (medium axis) of the sediment particle is measured to the nearest mm using a see-through ruler. Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

          <attributeDefinition>Pebble B-Axis Length (mm) of Particle 151. The b-axis (medium axis) of the sediment particle is measured to the nearest mm using a see-through ruler. Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

          <attributeDefinition>Pebble B-Axis Length (mm) of Particle 162. The b-axis (medium axis) of the sediment particle is measured to the nearest mm using a see-through ruler. Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

          <attributeDefinition>Pebble B-Axis Length (mm) of Particle 173. The b-axis (medium axis) of the sediment particle is measured to the nearest mm using a see-through ruler. Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season). For measurements &lt; 2 mm record "1". Do not assume a particle is &lt; 2 mm without measuring it first. Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other. It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis. Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis. Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot). The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects. A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.</attributeDefinition>

      <entityDescription>Pebble Count cumulative particle size class distribution and histogram data, including particle sizes at the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles, as summarized from Wolman pebble counts at each of the (3) cross sections for all (25) monitoring sites for 2006-2017. The size class ranges and descriptions are based on the USDA Forest Service Pebble Count Analyzer (2007). Analysis includes assumptions for the smallest and largest size classes, where for particles less than 2 mm, 1 was used, and bedrock was excluded in the analysis. Sizes at the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles were calculated by manually entering the largest size that yielded a percentile of just less than the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles, where percentiles were based on counts in the size classes.</entityDescription>

      <entityDescription>Pebble Count statistical p-value analysis at 0.05 alpha for fine sediments as summarized from Wolman pebble counts at each of the (3) cross sections for all (25) monitoring sites for 2006-2017. Four sediment sizes were analyzed, 2 mm, 4 mm, 8 mm, and 16 mm. Most of this analysis is based on or cross checked with the USDA Forest Service Pebble Count Analyzer (2007) and is referenced as such in the data table. Analysis includes assumptions for the smallest and largest size classes, where for particles less than 2 mm, 1 was used, and bedrock was excluded in the analysis.</entityDescription>

          <attributeDefinition>Test (1) Tails, whereas a 1-tailed test focuses on detecting a difference in a specific direction (e.g., greater than or less than) and a two-tailed test checks for any difference, regardless of direction (e.g., not equal to). A 1-sample t-test compares a single sample's mean to a known value, and a 2-sample t-test compares the means of two independent groups. In cumulative effects analysis such as in pebble counts, a uni-directional (or one-tailed) test can be appropriate for whether the sample reach is greater than the reference reach (Ps &gt; Pr). For example did a management action increase the fine sediment proportion of the particle size distribution? 1-tailed, uni-directional tests are more sensitive than 2-tailed, two-directional tests but do carry the danger of ignoring significant change in the opposite direction. For multiple criterion (ie, more than one particle size threshold such as 2mm, 4mm, 8mm, etc), they must be tested individually, and this value is from Test no 1.</attributeDefinition>

          <attributeLabel>T4_TAILS</attributeLabel>
          <attributeDefinition>Test (4) Tails, whereas a 1-tailed test focuses on detecting a difference in a specific direction (e.g., greater than or less than) and a two-tailed test checks for any difference, regardless of direction (e.g., not equal to). A 1-sample t-test compares a single sample's mean to a known value, and a 2-sample t-test compares the means of two independent groups. In cumulative effects analysis such as in pebble counts, a uni-directional (or one-tailed) test can be appropriate for whether the sample reach is greater than the reference reach (Ps &gt; Pr). For example did a management action increase the fine sediment proportion of the particle size distribution? 1-tailed, uni-directional tests are more sensitive than 2-tailed, two-directional tests but do carry the danger of ignoring significant change in the opposite direction. For multiple criterion (ie, more than one particle size threshold such as 2mm, 4mm, 8mm, etc), they must be tested individually, and this value is from Test no 4.</attributeDefinition>

It is often set to 0.05 (ie, 5%). Alpha is related to the confidence level, which is 1 - α. For example, if Alpha α = 0.05, the confidence level is 95% (1 - 0.05 = 0.95).
